# 1.3: Compare physical interface and cabling types

* Topics are split up by the exam topics list.
    1. Single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, copper
        * Fiber-Optic Basics
            * SFP - Small Form Factor Pluggable, transciever for fiber-optic cable to plug into on Cisco routers and switches.
            * Fiber-Optic cables use two separate cables for transmission (Tx) and receipt (Rx).

            * 1 - Fiberglass core, used to transmit data between two devices in the form of light.
            * 2 - Cladding, confines the light to the fiberglass core and reflects light.
            * 3 - Protective buffer, prevents the fiberglass core from breaking.
            * 4 - Outer jacket, shields the insides of the cable.
        * Multimode Fiber
            * Core diameter is wider than single-mode fiber.
            * Allows multiple angles (or modes) of light to enter the fiberglass core.
            * Longer cables than UTP, but shorter than single-mode fiber.
            * More cost-effective than single-mode fiber.
        * Single-mode Fiber
            * Core diameter is thinner than multimode fiber.
            * Light from a laser-based transmitter enters into the fiberglass core at one angle/mode.
            * Longer cable lengths than UTP or multimode fiber.
            * More expensive than multimode fiber.
        
        * Fiber-Optic Cable Standards

            | Informal Name | IEEE Standard | Speed | Cable Type | Maximum Length |
            |---------------|---------------|-------|------------|----------------|
            |1000BASE-LX    |802.3z         |1 Gbps |Multimode or single-mode|550m (MM), 5km (SM)|

        * Copper Cables
            * UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair, standard of copper cable used for Ethernet.
            * For 10BASE-T (Ethernet) and 100BASE-T (FastEthernet)
                - Routers, PCs, and firewalls receive data on pins 3 and 6, and transmit data on pins 1 and 2.
                - Switches receive data on pins 1 and 2, and transmit on 3 and 6.
            * Straight-through cables connect pins directly to their corresponding pin on the other device (1 to 1, 2 to 2...). Used for dissimilarly pinned devices.
            * Crossover cables connect pins to the corresponding pin of the opposite mode (3 Tx to 1 Rx, or 6 Tx to 2 Rx). Used for similarly pinned devices.
            * Auto MDI-X - A feature on modern network devices which allows automatic detection of Rx and Tx pins on their neighbor, and adjust their pins accordingly.
            * For 1000BASE-T (GigabitEthernet) and 10GBASE-T (TenGigabitEthernet)
                - Pin pairs are: 1 and 2, 3 and 6, 4 and 5, 7 and 8.
                - Each pair is bidirectional; they are not specific to transmitting or receiving data.
