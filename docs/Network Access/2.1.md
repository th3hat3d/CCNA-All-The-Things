# 2.1: Configure and verify VLANs (normal range) spanning multiple switches

+ About VLANs
    * A way of logically separating end hosts at Layer 2
    * Configured on a per-interface basis (switches)
    * Beneficial for both security andnetwork efficiency reasons.
    * Switches do not forward traffic directly between VLANs.
    * An access port is a switch port which belongs to one VLAN.
+ VLAN Configuration
    * "switchport mode access" to configure access mode on a switch port.
    * "switchport access vlan <num>" to configure the specific VLAN on a switch port.
    * "vlan <num>" command creates a VLAN from global configuration mode.
    * If a VLAN doesn't exist when assigned to a switch port, it's automatically created.
    * "switchport voice vlan <num>" to configure a specific voice VLAN on an access port.
